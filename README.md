The ArtGallery Management System is a software application that helps in managing an art gallery's operations, including customer and artist information, artwork inventory, and sales records. It allows the user to perform tasks such as adding, modifying, deleting, and searching for information about customers, artists, and artwork. The system also provides features such as advanced object-oriented programming, file handling, and exception handling, and all data is saved in a text file.
